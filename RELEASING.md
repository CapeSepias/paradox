1. Check [closed issues without a milestone](https://github.com/lightbend/paradox/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20no%3Amilestone) and either assign them the upcoming release milestone or 'invalid'
1. Wait until all running [Travis CI jobs](https://travis-ci.org/lightbend/paradox/builds) complete, if any.
1. Create a [new release](https://github.com/lightbend/paradox/releases/new) with:
    * the next tag version (e.g. `v0.4.3`)
    * title and release description including notable changes
    * link to the [milestone](https://github.com/lightbend/paradox/milestones) showing an overview of closed issues for this release
    * overview of contributors generated by [`sbt-authors`](https://github.com/2m/authors) (eg. `sbt authors v0.4.2 v0.4.3`)
1. Travis CI will start a [CI build](https://travis-ci.org/lightbend/paradox/builds) for the new tag and publish artifacts to Bintray and Sonatype.
